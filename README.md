## Usage

1. Clone this repo to your computer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vitalii-Prokopenko/webpack-js your-project-name
```

2. Create a new empty repo in your github account with `your-project-name`

3. In the new repo go to `Settings` and choose `Actions`, then `General`. In section `Workflow permissions` choose `Read and write permissions` and check the box `Allow GitHub Actions to approve pull requests`

4. Open cloned repo in `VSCode` on your computer and link it to the new repo

```bash
git remote -v
```
The meassage below means the local repo is linked to the `Boilerplate`
```bash
origin  https://github.com/Vitalii-Prokopenko/webpack-js (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Vitalii-Prokopenko/webpack-js (push) 
```

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Vitalii-Prokopenko/test-webpack.git
```

Check again:

```bash
git remote -v
```

If you get the message below, your local repo is now linked to the new empty repo on `GitHub`:

```bash
origin  https://github.com/Vitalii-Prokopenko/your-project-name (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Vitalii-Prokopenko/your-project-name (push) 
```
Next you push local repo to `GitHub`:

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

5. Install webpack dependencies on your computer

```bash
npm i
```

6. In `package.json` edit `homepage` by changing `Vitalii-Prokopenko` on `Your-user-name` and `webpack-js` on `your-project-name`.
Then push a commit to `GitHub` repo.
